        ### Attention
        Before you submit an issue, please review [the guidelines for this repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

        Have a question? Need help?
        Please use [our forum](https://groups.google.com/g/tesseract-ocr).

        Please follow these rules:
        * Don't open an issue for [Tesseract version which was released more than a year ago](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ReleaseNotes.html).
        * Don't open an issue which involves 3rd party tools that use Tesseract as a library. Only report about an issue with the Tesseract command line tool or the C/C++ API.
        * Please provide the input image.
        * Also provide output files (txt and/or tsv, hocr, pdf). You can make a zip archive that will contain these files, so GitHub will let you upload them.
        * Don't attach a screenshot of the command line and output. Instead, copy the text and paste it in your bug report.
